CARS-VS-BUS:
The Object Classification dataset has been taken from Kaggle. It was further broken down on my local machine and independent zipfiles were segregated for training and testing data which was in turn uploaded on Google Colaboratory. The project is a binary classification to identify images as belonging to buses or cars. The model is based on Convolutional Neural Networks.
